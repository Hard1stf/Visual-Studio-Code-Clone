# Visual Studio Code Clone

This project is a **Visual Studio Code Clone** built using **HTML5 and CSS3** only. The objective is to replicate the UI/UX of VS Code as closely as possible using fundamental web technologies without JavaScript or backend functionality.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is part of the **100xDevs** initiative and is aimed at improving skills in UI design, CSS layout techniques, and responsive design. The focus is to create a **fully responsive** and **visually accurate** static version of the VS Code editor.

## 🎯 Features Implemented

✅ **Header Section** - Includes the VS Code menu bar (File, Edit, View, etc.)<br>
✅ **Sidebar (Explorer Panel)** - Displays a simulated file tree<br>
✅ **Editor Window** - Shows an open file with syntax highlighting (static content)<br>
✅ **Status Bar** - Mimics the bottom status bar of VS Code<br>
✅ **Icons and Fonts** - Uses relevant VS Code-like icons and fonts for better realism<br>
✅ **Light & Dark Mode Support** (CSS only toggle via classes)<br>
✅ **Fully Responsive** - Works across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices<br>

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - For structuring the application layout.
- **CSS3** - For styling and layout management (including Flexbox & Grid).
- **Google Fonts & Icons** - To mimic VS Code's aesthetic.
- **CSS Variables** - For easy theme management (light/dark mode toggle).
